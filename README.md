# 🐍 Snake Game in Python (Jupyter Notebook) – Enhanced with Prompt Engineering

Welcome to my creative take on the classic **Snake Game**, built using **Python** and developed inside a **Jupyter Notebook**. What makes this project unique is the use of **Prompt Engineering** with AI (ChatGPT) to enhance game features, visuals, and logic — showing how developers can blend **code and creativity** through intelligent prompts!

## 🧠 Prompt Engineering in Action

This project demonstrates how prompt engineering can:

- Assist in writing game logic step-by-step
- Add features like background customization and speed control
- Improve user experience through design changes
- Turn plain code into a playable and polished mini-game

I interacted with ChatGPT to:
- Get step-by-step guidance on the game loop
- Understand how to implement collision logic
- Customize visuals like background color and snake appearance
- Manage game speed and difficulty
